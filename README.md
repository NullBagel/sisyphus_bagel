This is a repo for my side projects as I learn how to code in Python. I hope this serves as a time capsule for my learning progress.

## **SIDE PROJECTS**
### 1. 🥯 Sourdough Bagels 🥯 - 27/02/2026
  First project I decided to hunker down and complete. I originally wanted to include more things like:  
    - Difficulty settings where harder difficulty includes a text version, increased digits and lesser guesses  
    - A scoreboard where players can earn points; the lesser guess required the more points earned.  
    - A 'store' where players can use the points to buy items to help guessing the more difficult versions. Things can include a max_guess extender.  
  However, even coding the bare basics of the game is difficult. I might revisti this at a later date.
